				<p id="ans">Short answer: A noninvasive blood glucose monitoring biomedical device</p>
				<p id="content">
							Unlike standard single droplet blood glucose meters which require actual blood samples,
							GluMo uses infrared (IR) light to measure the amount of glucose in the user's blood without
							drawing any blood. The current method for monitoring blood glucose levels requires a drop of
							blood to be periodically obtained by pricking a fingertip with a retractable needle. However, this
							method is invasive, painful, and sometimes messy for the users. It can also cause infections over
							time with regular use due to the usage of un-sterilized needles, repeated usage of needles which
							were designed and manufactured for single usage, or the sharing of needles/prickers between
							patients. </p>
				<p id="content">
							Furthermore, GluMo is a monitoring system and not simply a meter. Meaning, GluMo
							continuously takes measurements and wirelessly updates the user's medical file. The file, which
							is in the form of a secure website, contains timestamped glucose level measurements, graphs,
							and even predictions of the user's near future glucose levels based on learned trends of the user's
							actual glucose levels over time. This online medical file can then be shared with the user's
							doctor, nurse, parents, children, etc. or for hospitalized patents or senior citizens at a
							nursing/retirement home the file can be securely shared with the facility's staff for ensuring the
							administration of accurate amounts of insulin and other medication, or even the adjustment of the
							dietary sugar levels in prepared meals for each individual patent/resident.
							The goal is to shrink the technology's physical size to a system on a chip which can then
							be intergraded into correctly existing wearables which have IR sensors such as smart watches or
							sowed into the fabric of clothing along with specialized IR emitters and sensors.
